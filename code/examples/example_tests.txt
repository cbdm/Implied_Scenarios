! This is an example of a test file.
! Lines starting with '!' are comments.

! Test file for example_traces


! categories of ISs can be created with '###', just like in this file.
! we have one category for the positive scenarios (generated by model_parser.py)
! and one for each common behavior (generated by analyze.py).
!
! This file is simply the inclusion of the positive scenarios from model_parser.py
! in the test file generated by analyze.py (and some comments :)


! positive scenarios generated by model_parser.py have a comment preceding them
! this comment indicates which scenarios (bMSCs) were executed in that trace

### Positive Scenarios

! init, Scen1
0: p1.ur.inc, p1.na.inc, p2.ur.double, p2.na.double

! init, Scen2
1: p2.ur.double, p2.na.double, p1.ur.inc, p1.na.inc




! the analyze.py script will create a category for each common behavior
! the first thing in each one is a comment showing the messages that make up
! that CB; after that, all ISs of that CB will be listed, one per line.

### Common Behavior 0

!
! ['p1.ur.inc', 'p2.ur.double', 'p2.na.double']
!

0: p1.ur.inc, p2.ur.double, p2.na.double

### Common Behavior 1

!
! ['p2.ur.double', 'p1.ur.inc', 'p1.na.inc']
!

1: p2.ur.double, p1.ur.inc, p1.na.inc
